Python Programming Basics â€” Notebooks

This folder contains Google Colab notebooks created while studying the expressway to data science course on Coursera by the University of Colorado Boulder. 
The covered topics include:

variables.ipynb Covers basic variable declarations, assignments, and data types in Python. 
input_output.ipynb Demonstrates how to use input() for user input and print() for output. 
functions.ipynb Introduces user-defined functions, arguments, return values, and basic logic.
exercises.ipynb Includes practice problems and coding exercises based on course content.

These notebooks are based on course assignments and lecture exercises, created as part of personal learning and practice by Priscilla Wanjiru.
All notebooks were developed using Google Colab and saved to GitHub. This repo serves as my learning portfolio and revision tool.
